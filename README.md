# Portfolio Website
https://melisalazic.github.io/


## What is this for?
This portfolio serves to showcase my skills as well as to display my recent projects. I'll update my site as well as new projects.


## With what is the site build?
HTML, SASS, Bootstrap 5, jQuery and JS. 
(Maybe in the future, I'll rebuild the site with REACT.)


## Why Github Pages?
Right now, my site is not that large so I decided to host it here.


## Did you make the images?
Yes, all images, the logo and the 3 SVGs are made by me. Except the 2 FontAwesome Icons.


## Can I use this as a template?
For the code, sure. But please do not use the SVGs and images in other projects.
